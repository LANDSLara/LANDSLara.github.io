CONTENT

Meeting François & Thomas
- Js is very heavy + using arrays destroys the structure of the text > use css instead only on the thesisDescription span, ellipsis with fixed lenght in media queries + toggle to a class noEllipsis when clicked
- text is too small > the priority shouldn't be that it fits, but to invite to read (make it at least 20% bigger François said)
- scroll is necessary, you cannot force user to a specific size of screen and to not use it 
- Thomas wants vertical scroll but François said no no, horizontal is great > show that scroll is possible, with scrollbar for instance
- keep styling of selectors coherent on mobile and desktop, the whole website is quite flat, stay like that > no blur and animation + work with backgrounds, maybe white can work with padding on the span (but needs display:block then)
- change cursor when it's a link to another page (alias)
- make it more clear how to close the keyword thing on mobile, possibility to make it dissapear on scroll
