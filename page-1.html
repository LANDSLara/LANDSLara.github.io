        <h1>Pedagogy is key</h1>
        <p>Life gets easier when you don’t assume that people know. It is important to take time to explain.
          It appears that often, clients and/or collaborators are not ill-intentioned and do not mean to underpay you. They sometimes just don’t know how the work is organised, how long it takes, what each step involves (design, correction, testing,
          printing etc.). A little pedagogy is important. Making detailed, timed quotations (and respecting them) can help. Explaining some technical aspects too, as it can make more clear why the small modification they made last minute will require
          an extra day of work on you side, for instance.</p>

  
          <h1>Making 120 raviolis together is a good way to meet you internship provider</h1>
          <p>I don’t have much to add to that. It was great.</p>

        <h1>Tools matter</h1>
        <p>(And design is never neutral). Another thing I had a few ideas about, but that the internship (more precisely, the people with whom I had the internship with and the countless discussion we had about this topic) helped me clarify.
          In design education, never questionned what they imply in terms of hegemony and politics, of access, of the econmical systems it supports, in the shapes it creates and the heterogenisation of design
          More than that, not real introduction to the alternatives</p>

        <h1>Logistics are work, logistics are care</h1>
        <p>Answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing are usually not regarded as very exciting tasks. They are left aside, for later, for when there is more time. They don’t appear on quotations and schedules
          because they are not considered to be ‘real work’.
          But logistics are vital parts of any activity, and are, indeed labour intensive.
          Answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing is labour intensive.
          Answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing is a vital part of any activity.
          However, answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing are often invisibilised and disregarded.</p>
      
          <h1>It doesn’t stop after school</h1>
          <p>You don’t stop learning after you graduate, you don’t have to figure out everything, you continue to meet people, to exchange, to learn and to grow. The downside is apparently the doubts and existential crisis remain too.</p>
       
          <h1>Research is not that scary</h1>
        <p>It seems that research is actually not this huge thing where you have to bring absolute answers, come to definitive conclusions, and be extremely exhaustive about a specific topic that no one has researched on before. Rather it seems that it is more about asking questions, collecting fragments of answers, tying to connect them, inventing new theories and prospects, find tiny tiny traces and follow them to see where they lead.
          Research is actually not THAAAAAT scary.</p>

        <h1>Everyone should read The Tyranny of Structurlesness</h1>
        <p>Working in a group is not that easy, even, and maybe especially when the group is not structured or hierarchized and relationships are supposed to be horizontal. 
          Saying it is not enough to make a reality, and usually power dynamics still exists within these groups, often reproducing the exact ones that they were trying to avoid with a non-hierarchical structure. This text have been of great help during this internship.</p>

          <h1>Never alone: to think of creation in terms of contibution</h1>
          <p>I needed to kill once and for all the figure of the designer as an individual creator, magically touched by the graces of talent and inspiration, and who alone creates an original, unique, genius work. And with this the idea that it is the
            only and most valuable form of creation.
            I most certainly had some ideas about it before, but this figure kept pursuing (and terrifying) me. I kind of wanted to be touched by the graces of talent and inspiration too.
            The last weeks enabled me to realise that they don’t exist. That you never work alone. That there are many people — always, but perhaps even more so in graphic design — involved in the processes of creation. Printers, others designers,
            interns, collaborators, clients, this friend with whom you shared you ideas at lunch, or this book you read when you were 12 and inlfluenced in some ways the project you are working on now.
            Some of them are physically present, and some of them live in your imaginary museum.
            It started to make me think of creation in terms of collective contributions rather than individual authorship, and to make we wonder, why then, if design is enivitabley collective and collaborative, our studies are so individual and
            individualistic? </p>

        <h1>Resources and knowledges are to share</h1>
        <p>Seeing the joy and generosity with which the people I met during my internship shared their skills, knowledges, tips, and time I realized there were a problem with school. There is a competitive atmosphere that pushes everyone to gatekeep their skills, knowledges, tips, and time. And make us all sad, individualistic and lonely designers who are too afraid to ask for help or to share what they learned with others. It would be nice if it changed. </p>

        <h1>Money talks — on the easy task of preserving a semblance of financial stability while not exploiting yourself, selling your soul or losing your sanity</h1>
        <p>Money talks happened on an almost daily basis. They don’t seem to be very exciting for anyone and usually christallized some tensions. How much money do we actually need? What can and cannot we compromise on? Is it okay to go over the planned hours if something is not done with a project? How are those hours accounted for? Should money (or the lack of it) be a reason to not participate and engage in interesting/exciting/useful projects? What does it imply to have an economical system that relies mostly or partly on private funds?</p>



        <h1>Doing two internship at the same time is not the best idea I had.</h1>
        <p>It seems to work for some people though.</p>
