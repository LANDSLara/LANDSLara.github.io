        <h1>Pedagogy is key</h1>
        <p>Life gets easier when you don’t assume that people know. It is important to take time to explain.
          It appears that often, clients and/or collaborators are not ill-intentioned and do not mean to underpay you. They sometimes just don’t know how the work is organised, how long it takes, what each step involves (design, correction, testing,
          printing etc.). A little pedagogy is important. Making detailed, timed quotations (and respecting them) can help. Explaining some technical aspects too, as it can make more clear why the small modification they made last minute will require
          a
          extra day of work on you side, for instance.</p>

        <h1>Never alone: to think of creation in terms of contibution</h1>
        <p>I needed to kill once and for all the figure of the designer as an individual creator, magically touched by the graces of talent and inspiration, and who alone creates an original, unique, genius work. And with this the idea that it is the
          only and most valuable form of creation.
          I most certainly had some ideas about it before, but this figure kept pursuing (and terrifying) me. I kind of wanted to be touched by the graces of talent and inspiration too.
          The last weeks enabled me to realise that they don’t exist. That you never work alone. That there are many people — always, but perhaps even more so in graphic design — involved in the processes of creation. Printers, others designers,
          interns, collaborators, clients, this friend with whom you shared you ideas at lunch, or this book you read when you were 12 and inlfluenced in some ways the project you are working on now.
          Some of them are physically present, and some of them live in your imaginary museum.
          It started to make me think of creation in terms of collective contributions rather than individual authorship, and to make we wonder, why then, if design is enivitabley collective and collaborative, our studies are so individual and
          individualistic? </p>

        <h1>Tools matter</h1>
        <p>(And design is never neutral). Another thing I had a few ideas about, but that the internship (more precisely, the people with whom I had the internship with and the countless discussion we had about this topic) helped me clarify.
          In design education, never questionned what they imply in terms of hegemony and politics, of access, of the econmical systems it supports, in the shapes it creates and the heterogenisation of design
          More than that, not real introduction to the alternatives</p>

        <h1>Logistics are work, logistics are care</h1>
        <p>Answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing are usually not regarded as very exciting tasks. They are left aside, for later, for when there is more time. They don’t appear on quotations and schedules
          because they are not considered to be ‘real work’.
          But logistics are vital parts of any activity, and are, indeed labour intensive.
          Answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing is labour intensive.
          Answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing is a vital part of any activity.
          However, answering emails, completing administrative tasks, organising, accounting, filing are often invisibilised and disregarded.</p>

        <h1>Everyone should read The Tyranny of Structurlesness</h1>
        <p>Working in a group is not that easy. It’s not because we say that a system is horizontal that it is. Usually reproduces existing power dynamics that we try to avoid.</p>

        <h1>Resources and knowledges are to share</h1>
        <p>Gatekeeping and competition in school > I found something completely different, joy and excitement in sharing resources, developing or using tools to do so
          Maybe also more coming from culture libre et du web mais vari patience and care to share knowledges and skills</p>

        <h1>Money talks — on the easy task of preserving a semblance of financial stability while not exploiting yourself, selling your soul or losing your sanity</h1>
        <p>Money talks happenned on an almost daily basis.
          How much do I need ?
          What can I compromise on and what I can’t
          Establishing ground rules, learning to budget right for quotation, going over the hours or not?

        <h1>Research is not that scary</h1>
        <p>Not this huge thing where you have to bring absolute answers and come to definitive conclusion and be extremely exhaustive.
          Rather, ask questions, collect fragments on the ground and wonder how to assemble them, find small traces in the desert and follow them (sometimes less scary than the tentaculesque)</p>

        <h1>It doesn’t stop after school</h1>
        <h1>It’s not only about design, it is not always about design</h1>
