    <h1 style="padding-top: 20vh; text-align: center;">This is a good example of the discrepancy between my expectations and reality. This page was supposed to use the API of a website called Zotero, to present here the content of the online library I created on it, collecting the many interesting references I encountered during those three months (and that I really wanted to share with others).
      It was a good idea and I was interested in kearning how to make it work technically, but the fourth year being the fourth year, I had absolutely no time to spend on it :(
      It will remain a project for future me! </h1>
