        </a>
        <p><span class="underline">Luuse</span> is a wonderful association whose number of members fluctuates according to the seasons and visiting interns. Their work focuses on the creation and development of alternative methods of publication and
          form-making, with a particular
          attention to the relationships and dynamics occuring between production tools, designers and users. Oscillating between research, teaching and commissioned works, Luuse defends an approach that puts at its heart the use and enhancement of
          free and open-source systems, both on practical and theoretical levels.</p>

        </a>
        <p><span class="underline">Loraine Furter</span> is an amazing graphic designer and researcher based in Brussels since 2007, specialized in editorial design, hybrid publishing and intersectional xfeminism. She designs and edits paper
          publications as well as web and digital
          ones, and is particularly interested in the interaction between these media.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">Juliana Vargas Zapata</span> is also an amazing graphic designer, who was collaborating with Loraine during the time I was there. Her work focuses on Latin American pop culture and
          diasporic identity, and more
          specifically in the ways they relate to internet culture. In her practice, she strives to work from the position of a ‘professional amateur’. And she loves slides. She loves slides and she makes very cool slide jewellery.</p>
